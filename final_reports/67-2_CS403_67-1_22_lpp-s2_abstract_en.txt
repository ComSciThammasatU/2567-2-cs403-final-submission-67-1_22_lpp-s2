WEB APPLICATION FOR RESERVATION ROOMS IN FACULTY OF SCIENCE &TECHNOLOGY THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY 

ABSTRACT
Currently, booking classrooms within Building 2 at Thammasat University
requires a manual written request, which is then filed. Many users find this
process inconvenient and prefer to request bookings via LINE. However, this
creates an additional workload for staff and can cause delays.
To resolve these issues, the development team has created a web
application for booking classrooms in Lecture Hall Building 2 at Thammasat
University. This new system is designed to streamline the reservation process,
allowing users to book rooms quickly and conveniently, while also reducing
the administrative burden on staff, thus improving overall efficiency.The
developers hope that this application will be beneficial to departments and
personnel within the Faculty of Science at Thammasat University
